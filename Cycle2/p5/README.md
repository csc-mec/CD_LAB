# Cycle 2 — p5

Files:
- `p5.c`

Brief description:

`p5.c` is a C source file for a Cycle 2 lab exercise. Cycle 2 typically introduces lex/yacc and parsing tasks; this program may implement a specific parsing/analysis task or another compiler-lab exercise in C. I can extract more details from the source on request.
