# Cycle 2 — p6

Files:
- `p6.l`

Brief description:

This folder contains a lexical specification file (`p6.l`) for use with `flex` (or `lex`). It implements a lexical analyzer for the assigned lab problem — tokenizing input according to the rules defined in the `.l` file. To produce a scanner, run `flex p6.l` and compile the generated C code.
