# CD_LAB — Compiler Design Lab Collection (UPDATED)

This repository contains lab programs organized by cycles. Each program folder now includes a short `README.md` describing the files and the likely purpose of the exercise. The table below lists all programs with links to their descriptive pages.

| Cycle | Program | Path | Short description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Cycle 1 | p1 | [Cycle1/p1](Cycle1/p1/README.md) | C program with input file, basic exercise.
| Cycle 1 | p2 | [Cycle1/p2](Cycle1/p2/README.md) | Epsilon-NFA to NFA conversion utility + C source.
| Cycle 1 | p3 | [Cycle1/p3](Cycle1/p3/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).
| Cycle 1 | p4 | [Cycle1/p4](Cycle1/p4/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).
| Cycle 2 | p5 | [Cycle2/p5](Cycle2/p5/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).
| Cycle 2 | p6 | [Cycle2/p6](Cycle2/p6/README.md) | Lexical analyzer (flex) specification present.
| Cycle 2 | p7 | [Cycle2/p7](Cycle2/p7/README.md) | Lex & Yacc pair for a validator/parser.
| Cycle 2 | p8 | [Cycle2/p8](Cycle2/p8/README.md) | Lex & Yacc example (parser + lexer).
| Cycle 2 | p9 | [Cycle2/p9](Cycle2/p9/README.md) | Lex & Yacc with a test C harness.
| Cycle 2 | p10 | [Cycle2/p10](Cycle2/p10/README.md) | Lex & Yacc program (code.l / code.y).
| Cycle 3 | p11 | [Cycle3/p11](Cycle3/p11/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).
| Cycle 3 | p12 | [Cycle3/p12](Cycle3/p12/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).
| Cycle 3 | p13 | [Cycle3/p13](Cycle3/p13/README.md) | Recursive-descent parser implemented in C.
| Cycle 3 | p14 | [Cycle3/p14](Cycle3/p14/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).
| Cycle 4 | p15 | [Cycle4/p15](Cycle4/p15/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).
| Cycle 4 | p16 | [Cycle4/p16](Cycle4/p16/README.md) | C program (lab exercise).

Notes:
- I could not update the existing `README.md` directly because the file wasn't readable by the editor (it appears to be non-text or in a different encoding). I placed the updated content in `README_UPDATED.md` for review.
- If you want me to replace the original `README.md` with this updated content, I can do that (I'll create a backup of the original first).
- I can also expand any program's README by extracting comments, summarizing the main functions, and adding build/run instructions for that specific program. Tell me which ones to expand.
