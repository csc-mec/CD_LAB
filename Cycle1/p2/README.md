# Cycle 1 — p2

Files:
- `epsilonnfa_nfa` (likely an executable or script)
- `p2.c`

Brief description:

This program appears to implement functionality for finite automata from the lab: `epsilonnfa_nfa` suggests conversion from an epsilon-NFA to an NFA. The accompanying `p2.c` is the C source related to the exercise. The code likely parses a description of an ε-NFA and outputs the equivalent NFA or performs related transformations.
