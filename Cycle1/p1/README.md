# Cycle 1 — p1

Files:
- `p1.c`
- `input.txt`

Brief description:

This folder contains `p1.c`, a C source file for a Cycle 1 lab exercise. The program reads input from `input.txt` (sample input provided) and demonstrates a basic C programming concept used in the lab (I/O and simple processing). Use this README as a starting point; if you want, I can extract comments or key functions from `p1.c` and expand the explanation.
