# Cycle 1 — p4

Files:
- `p4.c`

Brief description:

`p4.c` contains a C implementation of a Cycle 1 lab exercise. The file likely demonstrates another foundational concept in compiler-design-related coursework (e.g., simple lexical tasks, pattern matching or automata examples). Ask me to expand this README by scanning `p4.c` for comments and function summaries.
