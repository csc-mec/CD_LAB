Brief description:

`p3.c` is a C program for a Cycle 1 lab problem. The source implements a small exercise from the course; typical tasks in this cycle include string processing, simple automata, or parsing demonstrations. If you want a detailed summary, I can scan `p3.c` and extract the main algorithm and usage.
